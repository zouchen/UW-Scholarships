Sample API JSON output:
https://github.com/uWaterloo/api-documentation/blob/master/v2/awards/undergraduate.md


1. To fetch the JSON file to local machine:

brew install wget
wget https://api.uwaterloo.ca/v2/awards/undergraduate.json?key=4abfd4892a60a729f6c2225466121a44


2. To connect to the University of Waterloo Open Data API through the official Python wrapper:
(currently under maintainance due to an Import Error)

from uwaterlooapi import UWaterlooAPI
uw = UWaterlooAPI(api_key="4abfd4892a60a729f6c2225466121a44")
